# The Wordle Clone - Extended

This assignment picks up where we left off in the first assignment. Here, we will make two updates to the game:
1. When the game starts, the word to be guessed will be picked from random from a text file on our class server. Design in a way that allows us to change the location we get the words from in the future. Most of the existing code should not have to change, but new code may have to be written minimally to accommodate that.
2. When a user presses the "Guess" button, check if the users input is a word with correct spelling by making a query to a spell-check service on the class server. The site will return a true or false for correct spelling. If the spelling is correct, continue to provide the feedback to the user for the word entered. If the spelling is incorrect, display "Not a word.". Design in a way that will allow us to change the spell-check service without having to change most of the code. Again, new code may have to be written minimally to accommodate that. The player can continue to edit the current guess if the word entered has incorrect spelling. They don't lose a turn for the misspelled word, and the "Guess" button is disabled until they change the word after entering a wrong spelling.
