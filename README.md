# Software Design (Spring 2022)

This repo is dedicated to the work that was done in Venkat Subramaniam's Software Design course at the University of Houston.<br>
<br>
The focus of the course was to practice design techniques such as:
+ Test-driven development
+ Following the DYSOLD principle (a variation of the SOLID principle, excluding the Interface Segregation Principle)
  + **D**on't Repeat Yourself
  + **Y**ou aren't going to need it (yet)
  + **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
  + **O**pen Close Principle
  + **L**iskov Substitution Principle
  + **D**ependency Inversion Principle
+ Utilizing Design Patterns such as
  + Abstract Factory
  + Factory Method
  + Adapter
  + Builder
  + Facade
  + Decorator
